  I like to use Github to follow projects I'm interested in, or host little projects im working on.
  
### Current Interests
  I currently am working on a few little Discord bots just for fun!
  Most stuff I work on is related to osu! in some capacity, as its my favorite game.
  
### Pronouns
  He/Him
  
### Languages
JS, Python, and a tiny bit of C# (working on it)
